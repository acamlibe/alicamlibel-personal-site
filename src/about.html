                  Hi, my name is Ali Camlibel. I am a full-time junior software
                  developer and a part-time data science student. In my free time,
                  I DJ for my friends, research everything about cars (especially
                  engines), and work on my personal software projects. I also have a little pug who I love very much.

                <h2>As a Software Developer...</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                I believe that I am a very disciplined software developer. I
                continuously work towards achieving better code quality by
                challenging code I've written in the past and finding ways to
                improve upon it. Having known that I've written, to the best of
                my abilities, maintainable, performant, and clean code gives me
                personal satisfaction and confidence that the software will
                succeed.

              <h3>
                My top software design philosophies
                <small>(in order of importance)</small>:
              </h3>
              <ol class="philosophies-list content-box">
                <li>
                  <strong>KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid)</strong> - The question
                  I frequently ask myself: can someone understand my code
                  without extensive comments in my code or detailed
                  documentation?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Code Consistency</strong> - Code should be implemented
                  in a consistent manner. Whether it's naming conventions or the
                  architecture. A consistent codebase leads to better
                  maintenance and reusability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong> - My father
                  once told me, "If you can't describe what a class or function
                  does in one sentence, it's doing too much."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Performance</strong> - Imagine a Google search taking
                  longer than 10 seconds, in this day and age. Systems should be
                  as performant as can be, without sacrificing maintainability
                  (unless it is absolutely necessary).
                </li>
              </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
              <div>
                <h3>
                  My top web design philosophies
                  <small>(in order of importance)</small>:
                </h3>
              </div>
              <ol class="content-box philosophies-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Lightweight Page Load</strong> - Gone were the days of
                  websites that served maybe a few hundred kilobytes worth of
                  bandwidth to users. Nowadays, you go to Google.com and load
                  ~3.4MB. Obviously with caching and the use of CDNs, it's not such
                  a big deal, but I feel it has made developers too carefree.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Semantic HTML</strong> - Semantic tags in HTML have
                  made working with HTML so much more comprehensible. It also
                  allows devices to better interpret webpages to translate to
                  disabled users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Not everything has to be an SPA</strong> - JavaScript
                  frameworks like Angular and React have taken the world by
                  storm. Nowadays, knowing one of the two is almost a
                  requirement for any web developer role. It's almost as if it's
                  a standard now, but I believe that you need to look at your
                  needs carefully. If you do not need a very dynamic page (such
                  as the site you are on right now), then it is perfectly OK to
                  serve HTML directly from a server.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Design against your target audience</strong> - Using
                  design systems such as Google's Material, Apple's Human
                  Interface Guidelines, or Microsoft's Fluent is not a
                  requirement for good design. Design should complement
                  usability for your specific target audience. For example, in
                  the energy sector many users are engineers or business
                  experts, and often times they will favor higher density
                  designs since they need to see a lot of data at once.
