                  I work with various teams to develop solutions for projects funded by energy utilities. Each team uses a different technology stack, depending on the project needs.

                <p>
                  My official role is a "Software Developer", but the role is so much more than that. We are essentially software developers, database designers, UI/UX designers, and even product owners. We work towards bringing complete solutions to project managers in a timely manner and within budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since EPRI is a research institute, learning and personal growth are promoted and encouraged. We are required to find interesting topics to research and present on. Some of my presentations have included topics on software architecture, clean code, and useful design patterns.

                  This was my first position right after college. My primary responsibilities included software maintenance and directly working with business users within Duke Energy who used our software or had some need for software.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The system that my team maintained was highly complex and mission critical to Duke Energy. The users of our software, primarily a team referred to as <i>Unit Commitment</i>, had to rely on our system to make important decisions that impacted many other teams such as traders and plant dispatchers. Since our users worked 24/7, we had an on-call schedule to support them if any part of the system is malfunctioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I primarily worked towards rewriting legacy Excel workbooks and web apps with modern implementations that had better UI/UX, a more modern technology stack, and better performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My favorite part of this position was learning different ways of using C# - Blazor, .NET Core Web APIs, and Entity Framework Core.

                  I worked at Ozmo part-time while studying at Virginia Tech for my undergrad. The role consisted of processesing screenshots of screens on various Android devices that we would put together to develop emulations of the device. These emulations are used by support agents who work for phone carriers such as Verizon and Telus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The role had many steps to follow, leading many content developers to make quality assurance errors. I wanted to automate some of the process, so I built two tools, one as a Java console application, and another as a C# WinForms application. My team used these tools to speed up development and make less errors. I also wrote some Photoshop scripts to save time processing images.
